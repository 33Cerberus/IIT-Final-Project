# Keyword-Based Automation Workflow (n8n)

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains an **automation workflow built with n8n** that provides **quick information about a specific topic** based on a simple keyword command.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate how workflow automation can be used to process user input, extract keywords, and return concise, relevant information.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **n8n** – Workflow automation tool
- **Docker** – Containerized environment
- **Docker Compose** – Service orchestration
- **External APIs** (optional) – Weather, knowledge, or AI APIs
- **GitHub** – Version control

## 🧠 Workflow Logic
1. **Input Trigger**  
   The workflow receives a text command in the format:
2. **Keyword Extraction**  
The keyword (e.g., `weather`) is parsed from the input.

3. **Information Lookup**  
The workflow retrieves relevant information using:
- Predefined responses, or
- External APIs (depending on configuration).

4. **Output Response**  
A short, readable summary is returned to the user.
